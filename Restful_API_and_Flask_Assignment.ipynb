        "Q1. What is a RESTful API?\n",
        "   -A RESTful API (Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface) is a web service that follows the principles of REST architecture, allowing different software systems to communicate over the HTTP protocol.\n",
        "\n",
        " Q2.Explain the concept of API specification.\n",
        "   -An API specification is a formal document that outlines the structure, behavior, and usage of an Application Programming Interface (API). It defines how software components or systems can interact with the API, detailing the available endpoints (or routes), the types of requests that can be made (such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), the expected inputs and outputs, authentication requirements, and any error handling mechanisms. Essentially, an API specification serves as a contract between the API provider and the client, ensuring that both sides have a clear understanding of how to communicate effectively.\n",
        "   A well-defined API specification includes descriptions of the request formats, such as required headers, path or query parameters, and the structure of the request body (often in JSON or XML). It also outlines the structure of the responses, specifying the data types, fields, and potential error messages returned by the server. Authentication methods, such as API keys or OAuth tokens, are also part of the specification to ensure secure access to the API.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q3.What is Flask, and why is it popular for building APIs?\n",
        "  -Flask is a lightweight and flexible web framework for Python that is widely used to build web applications and APIs. It is based on the Werkzeug toolkit and Jinja2 templating engine, and it follows a microframework philosophy—meaning it provides only the essential components to get started, while giving developers the freedom to add extensions as needed. Flask does not enforce a specific structure or dependency, making it ideal for both beginners and advanced users who want full control over their application architecture.\n",
        "  Flask is especially popular for building RESTful APIs due to its simplicity, minimal setup, and powerful routing capabilities. Developers can quickly define endpoints, handle HTTP requests, and return JSON responses with just a few lines of code. Its support for third-party extensions such as Flask-RESTful, Flask-JWT, and Flask-SQLAlchemy allows for scalable and modular development. Additionally, Flask integrates easily with tools like Postman, Swagger (via Flask-Swagger or Flask-RESTX), and frontend frameworks, making it a go-to choice for backend APIs in both small and large projects.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q4.What is routing in Flask?\n",
        "  -Routing in Flask refers to the process of mapping URLs (web addresses) to specific functions in your Python code that should handle the request. When a user visits a particular URL or sends a request (like GET or POST) to the server, Flask uses routing to decide which piece of code should respond. This is done using the @app.route() decorator, which tells Flask that a particular function should be triggered when a certain path is requested.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q5.How do you create a simple Flask application?\n",
        "  -To create a simple Flask application, you first need to install Flask using Python’s package manager by running pip install flask. Once installed, you can start building a basic application by importing Flask and creating an instance of the Flask class. After that, you define routes using the @app.route() decorator to map specific URLs to Python functions. Each function returns a response (like plain text or HTML) that gets sent back to the user's browser.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q6.What are HTTP methods used in RESTful APIs?\n",
        "  -In RESTful APIs, HTTP methods are used to define the type of operation a client wants to perform on a resource. The most commonly used HTTP methods are GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE, each serving a specific purpose in the context of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.\n",
        "  GET is used to retrieve data from the server. It is a read-only operation and does not modify any data.\n",
        "  POST is used to create a new resource on the server, such as adding a new user or submitting a form.\n",
        "  PUT is used to completely update an existing resource by replacing it with new data.\n",
        "  PATCH is similar to PUT but is used for partial updates, allowing the client to change only specific fields.\n",
        "  DELETE is used to remove a resource from the server.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q7.What is the purpose of the @app.route() decorator in Flask?\n",
        "  -In Flask, the @app.route() decorator is used to define the URL path (or \"route\") that should trigger a specific function in your web application. This decorator connects a URL endpoint to a view function—the block of code that should run when that URL is accessed by a user or a client. When a request is made to the specified route, Flask calls the associated function and sends its return value (like HTML or JSON) as the response.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q8.What is the difference between GET and POST HTTP methods?\n",
        "   -The GET and POST HTTP methods are both used to send requests to a server, but they serve different purposes and behave differently. GET is used to retrieve data from a server. It is a read-only operation and does not make any changes to the server’s data. When you use GET, any parameters or data you send are appended to the URL as query strings (e.g., example.com/search?query=flask), which makes it visible in the browser and easily shareable. GET requests are also cached by browsers and can be bookmarked.On the other hand, POST is used to send data to the server to create or process something, such as submitting a form or adding a new item to a database. The data in a POST request is sent in the body of the request, not in the URL, making it more secure for sending sensitive information. POST requests are not cached, cannot be bookmarked, and generally result in a change on the server, such as storing new data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q9.How do you handle errors in Flask APIs?\n",
        "  -In Flask APIs, error handling is essential for providing clear, consistent, and user-friendly responses when something goes wrong. Flask allows you to handle errors by using custom error handlers, the abort() function, and try-except blocks within your route functions. One common approach is to define error handler functions using the @app.errorhandler() decorator. For example, you can catch a 404 Not Found error and return a custom JSON message instead of the default HTML response. Similarly, you can handle 400 Bad Request, 500 Internal Server Error, or any custom exceptions your application raises.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q10.How do you connect Flask to a SQL database?\n",
        "   -To connect Flask to a SQL database, you typically use a library such as SQLAlchemy, which is a popular Object Relational Mapper (ORM) in Python. Flask provides integration for SQLAlchemy through the extension Flask-SQLAlchemy, which simplifies connecting your Flask app to databases like SQLite, MySQL, or PostgreSQL. To get started, you install the extension using pip install flask-sqlalchemy. Then, you configure your database connection string (called the URI) in the Flask app’s configuration, usually using app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI\"].\n",
        "  Once configured, you create a database object using SQLAlchemy(app) and define your database tables as Python classes called models. Each class represents a table, and each attribute represents a column. After defining your models, you can create the tables using db.create_all() and interact with them using Python instead of raw SQL queries.   \n",
        "\n",
        "Q11.What is the role of Flask-SQLAlchemy?\n",
        "   -Flask-SQLAlchemy is an extension for Flask that provides seamless integration with SQLAlchemy, a powerful Object Relational Mapper (ORM) for Python. Its main role is to simplify working with relational databases in Flask applications by allowing developers to interact with the database using Python classes and objects instead of raw SQL queries. This makes database operations more intuitive, readable, and secure.With Flask-SQLAlchemy, you can define database models as Python classes, where each class represents a table and each class attribute corresponds to a column. It also provides helper methods to create, query, update, and delete records. For example, instead of writing SQL like SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = 1, you can simply write User.query.get(1) in Python. Flask-SQLAlchemy also handles database connections, sessions, and integrates well with Flask's application context.    \n",
        "\n",
        "Q12.What are Flask blueprints, and how are they useful?\n",
        "   -Flask blueprints are a way to organize a Flask application into modular, reusable components. They allow you to group related routes, templates, static files, and other functionality together, making it easier to manage large or complex applications. Instead of defining all your routes and logic in a single app.py file, you can split them into separate blueprint files based on different features or sections of your application—such as user authentication, admin dashboard, or API endpoints.\n",
        "   Each blueprint can be defined in its own file using the Blueprint class from flask, and later registered with the main Flask application using app.register_blueprint(). This makes your code cleaner, more maintainable, and easier to scale as your project grows. Blueprints also support URL prefixes, allowing you to group routes under common paths (like /api, /admin, etc.) without writing repetitive code.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q13.What is the purpose of Flask's request object?\n",
        "  -The request object in Flask is used to access data that a client sends to the server when making an HTTP request. It is part of Flask’s flask module and provides a convenient way to handle incoming data such as form inputs, JSON payloads, query parameters, headers, cookies, and even uploaded files. Whether the request is made through a browser, API client (like Postman), or another service, Flask's request object allows the server to read and process the incoming information.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q14.How do you create a RESTful API endpoint using Flask?\n",
        "   -To create a RESTful API endpoint using Flask, you define a route using the @app.route() decorator and implement a view function that handles HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, or DELETE. Inside the view function, you use Flask's request object to access incoming data and return responses in JSON format using the jsonify() function. This setup allows you to perform standard CRUD operations—such as retrieving, creating, updating, or deleting resources—following REST principles.\n",
        "\n",
        " Q15.What is the purpose of Flask's jsonify() function?\n",
        "  -The purpose of Flask’s jsonify() function is to convert Python data structures—such as dictionaries and lists—into a JSON-formatted HTTP response. JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is the standard format for exchanging data in RESTful APIs. When building an API in Flask, you often need to send data from the server to the client in a structured, readable format. jsonify() handles this by serializing the data to JSON and also automatically sets the appropriate Content-Type header (application/json) in the response.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q16.Explain Flask's url_for() function.\n",
        "   -Flask's url_for() function is used to generate dynamic URLs for view functions based on their names, rather than hardcoding paths into your application. This is especially useful for maintaining clean, DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) code. When you use url_for(), Flask looks up the function name you provide and returns the correct URL path for it, even if that path changes later in your application.            \n",
        "\n",
        "Q17.How does Flask handle static files (CSS, JavaScript, etc.)?\n",
        "   -Flask handles static files—such as CSS, JavaScript, and images—through a special folder named static/ located in the root directory of your Flask project. By default, Flask automatically serves any file placed in this static/ folder at the URL path /static/<filename>.\n",
        "\n",
        " Q18.What is an API specification, and how does it help in building a Flask API?\n",
        "   -An API specification is a detailed blueprint that defines how an API should behave. It describes the endpoints, HTTP methods (like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), input parameters, expected responses, data formats (usually JSON), authentication methods, and error handling rules. This specification acts as a contract between the backend developers, frontend developers, and any external users of the API, ensuring that everyone knows exactly how the API should be used and what to expect from it.\n",
        "   When building a Flask API, having a clear API specification is extremely helpful. It allows you to design your endpoints and routes in an organized, predictable way and ensures that your API adheres to consistent standards. Developers can use tools like OpenAPI (Swagger) to write the specification, which can then be used to automatically generate documentation, client libraries, and test cases. In Flask, extensions like Flask-RESTX or Flask-RESTful allow you to define routes and simultaneously generate API docs based on the specification.  \n",
        "\n",
        "Q19.What are HTTP status codes, and why are they important in a Flask API?\n",
        "   -HTTP status codes are standardized three-digit numbers sent by the server in response to a client’s request, indicating the outcome of that request. These codes are part of the HTTP protocol and help both humans and programs understand whether a request was successful, failed, or needs further action. In the context of a Flask API, returning the correct HTTP status code is essential because it informs the client (e.g., a browser, mobile app, or API consumer) about the result of their interaction with the server.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q20.How do you handle POST requests in Flask?\n",
        "   -In Flask, POST requests are handled by creating a route with the @app.route() decorator and specifying methods=['POST']. This allows the route to accept data sent by the client, such as form data or JSON payloads. Inside the view function, you can use the request object to access the incoming data. For form submissions, you use request.form, and for JSON data (commonly used in APIs), you use request.get_json().\n",
        "\n",
        "Q21.How would you secure a Flask API?\n",
        "   -Securing a Flask API involves implementing several layers of protection to prevent unauthorized access, data leaks, and other vulnerabilities. One of the most common methods is using authentication and authorization mechanisms, such as API keys, token-based authentication (e.g., JWT), or OAuth2. These ensure that only trusted users or systems can access certain endpoints. Flask extensions like Flask-JWT-Extended, Flask-Login, or Flask-OAuthlib can help manage secure access.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q22.What is the significance of the Flask-RESTful extension?\n",
        "   -Flask-RESTful is a powerful Flask extension that simplifies the process of building RESTful APIs by providing a clean and structured way to define API resources and their behavior. Instead of writing raw Flask routes with a mix of logic and request handling, Flask-RESTful allows you to organize your code using Python classes, where each class represents a resource (such as a user, item, or post) and supports various HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE through class methods.\n",
        "   One of the key benefits of Flask-RESTful is that it improves code readability, modularity, and reusability. It also provides built-in tools for request parsing, input validation, and standardized responses, which reduce the amount of boilerplate code and make APIs more consistent. For example, you can use reqparse to define expected input parameters and handle errors gracefully when data is missing or invalid.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q23.What is the role of Flask's session object?\n",
        "   -Flask's session object is used to store data across multiple requests made by the same user. It allows the server to remember information—such as user login status, preferences, or temporary values—between different HTTP requests. Unlike global variables, which are shared across all users, the session is unique to each individual user. Flask stores session data on the client side using secure cookies, and it signs the data with a secret key to prevent tampering.\n",
